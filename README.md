# SimBa2

SimBa2 is a Python package for predicting changes in protein stability upon mutation using the prediction methods SimBa-IB and SimBa-SYM. The program takes a PDB file as input, and outputs the predicted stability changes (in kcal/mol) for all possible single amino acid changes.

Negative ddG values signify destabilizing mutations.

The program can be run from the command line or used as a Python module.

## Installation

```
python -m pip install https://github.com/ktbaek/SimBa2/archive/main.tar.gz
```

## Usage

### Run from command line

The program takes a single PDB code or a local PDB file as input, and outputs two .csv files (SimBa-IB_<pdb-code>.csv and SimBa-SYM_<pdb-code>.csv) with predicted ddG values in kcal/mol for a saturated mutagenesis of the protein.

#### Examples

Analyze PDB structure 3BDN:
```
python -m simba2 3bdn
```
Keep downloaded PDB file in the current directory:
```
python -m simba2 3bdn --keep
```
Keep downloaded PDB file in another directory:
```
python -m simba2 3bdn --dir ../my_directory --keep
```
Analyze local PDB file of 3BDN:
```
python -m simba2 3bdn --file 3bdn.pdb
```
Help:
```
python -m simba2 --help
```

### Used as Python module

The package can also be used as a module in a Python script to analyze local PDB files.

Example:

```
from simba2 import methods as sb
sb.simba2_predict('3BDN', '3bdn.pdb')
```


## Output

The resulting .csv files (or dataframe when used in a Python script) have mostly self-explanatory column names.

The column named 'mean_RSA' shows the mean RSA value across chains if the structure is a homooligomer.

The column named 'Gene' shows the chain-assigned gene name as it appears in the header section of the PDB file. This can be useful when analyzing heterooligomeric proteins. Sometimes this column is empty.
